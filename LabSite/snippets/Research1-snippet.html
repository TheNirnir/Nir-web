		<p id="research-explanation">This series of studies focuses on positive outcomes of the unique life transitions to parenthood and grandparenthood, looking at well-being, life satisfaction, meaning in life, and in particular, personal growth. It examines a wide range of internal and external resources, and compares diverse birth circumstances, such as the birth of pre- and full-term babies, first vs. non-first child, and parenthood following reproductive treatment.</p>
