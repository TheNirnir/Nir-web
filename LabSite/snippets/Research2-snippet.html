		<p id="research-explanation">This longitudinal study is aimed at understanding internal and external resources (especially the support of participants’ mothers and mothers-in-law) that contribute to the mental health and personal growth of mothers of twins and single babies, pre- and full-terms alike. The study, begun in 2001, is both continuing to recruit new mothers, and following the development of mothers over the years as their children get older.</p>
