		fullName: "Prof. Orit Taubman&nbsp;- Ben&#8209;Ari",
		shortName: "OritT",
		content: "is a psychologist and professor at the Louis and Gabi Weisfeld School of Social Work at Bar-Ilan University in Israel. Her research focuses on two main interests. The first is intergenerational relationships and personal growth following life transitions, such as the transitions to parenthood and grandparenthood. In the wake of her ground-breaking research, her scholarly publications were among the first to introduce the construct of personal growth into the discourse of life transitions. Her studies examine both deleterious and positive or constructive predispositions and outcomes within families coping with various stress-related events, such as the birth of a pre-term infant, parenthood following fertility treatment, and parenting twins. The second focus of her research is the psychology of risk taking, especially reckless driving, with an emphasis on risk taking among adolescents and young adults. Over the years, she has studied youngsters during the stages of learning to drive and the early phases of driving, examining various issues, including the motivations for driving, gender differences, relevant personality traits, and the contribution of the family and peers. Within this framework, she has developed and confirmed the validity and reliability of instruments for assessing driving style (Multidimensional Driving Style Inventory; MDSI), as well as for assessing the attitudes of young drivers and their parents to the accompanied driving period (Attitudes Towards Accompanied Driving; ATAD). She has also developed a new theoretical concept, Family Climate for Road Safety, along with an instrument for its assessment (Family Climate for Road Safety Scale; FCRSS)."
