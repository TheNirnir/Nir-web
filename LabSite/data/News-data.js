		content: "We are very excited to announce that a new book: Pathways and barriers to parenthood &ndash; Existential concerns regarding fertility, pregnancy, and early parenthood, edited by Prof. Orit Taubman&nbsp;- Ben&#8209;Ari, has recently been published by Springer. The book explores the transition to parenthood from a holistic developmental approach, relating to barriers such as fertility problems and traumatic childbirth, as well as pathways such as positive experiences of pregnancy and childbirth. It presents an extended process, beginning with infertility issues, continuing with subjects pertaining to decisions regarding parenthood, pregnancy and birth, and ending with the early stages of parenthood from a positive psychology perspective. The volume draws on theories of resilience, meaning, terror management, and attachment, and considers psychological, sociological, legal, policy, medical, and therapy issues. It relates to the developmental needs of individuals and couples, as well as to the role played by family, society, and the media, offering a comprehensive in-depth evaluation of the latest topics.",

		content: "A new paper entitled Driven by Emotions: The Association between Emotion Regulation, Forgiveness and Driving Styles by Meital Navon and Orit Taubman&nbsp;- Ben&#8209;Ari, has recently been published in Transportation Research Part F: Traffic Psychology and Behaviour. The paper shows that drivers adopting the three maladaptive driving styles (reckless and careless, angry and hostile, anxious) were characterized by a higher level of general difficulties in emotion regulation and by low trait forgivingness. In contrast, drivers adopting the patient and careful driving style had fewer difficulties in all aspects of emotion regulation, as well as higher trait forgivingness. The theoretical contribution of the study lays in showing that difficulties in emotion regulation and forgivingness are closely associated with maladaptive driving styles- an issue crucial for promoting the substantial efforts being invested in the attempts to reduce road crashes.",

		content: "A new paper entitled What Potential Role Do Siblings Play in Young Drivers&prime; Driving Styles? by Orit Taubman&nbsp;- Ben&#8209;Ari, has recently been published in Transportation Research Part F: Traffic Psychology and Behaviour. The paper claims that siblings&prime; contribution to young drivers&prime; driving styles has received little attention. The study described in the paper examined the unique and combined contributions of sibling relations and perceived sibling&prime;s driving style to the self-reported driving styles of young drivers. The findings revealed significant associations between the driving style of the young driver and their sibling, and significant contributions of both sibling relations and perceived sibling driving style to the self-reported driving style of the young driver. The results indicate the potentially overlooked importance of siblings in determining how young drivers choose to drive, strengthening previous evidence regarding the strong influence of the family&prime;s global climate on the dynamics surrounding youngsters&prime; driving.",

		content: 'A new paper entitled &ldquo;Maternal mental health over four years following childbirth: The contribution of birth circumstances and psycho-social factors&rdquo;, by Ginna Porat-Zyman, Orit Taubman&nbsp;- Ben&#8209;Ari, Iris Morag and Jacob Kuint has recently been published in Women and Health. The paper describes a study which aimed to identify mothers at risk for poorer maternal mental health (MMH) one month post-partum and to determine changes in MMH over four years, in relation to birth circumstances (singleton/twins, full-term/pre-term infant/s, first/ non-first child), internal resources (adult attachment styles), and external resources (marital quality and support from the maternal grandmother) at one month post-partum. Shortly after birth, mothers at risk for poorer MMH were those who gave birth prematurely or were characterized by insecure attachment styles, lower marital quality, younger age, or a higher level of education. The mothers with a good prognosis for improvement in MMH were those who had given birth prematurely or were younger, more highly educated, or multiparous. Women with insecure attachment or lower marital quality reported lower MMH one month after delivery that did not improve over time, and the MMH of older or less educated mothers deteriorated over time. Marital quality mitigated or exacerbated the effects of birth circumstances and insecure attachment style on MMH shortly after giving birth.',

		content: 'A new paper entitled &ldquo;Mental Health of Women Entering Fertility Treatment: What Role do Age and Internal Resources Play?&rdquo; by Shirley Ben Shlomo, Vera Skvirsky, Orit Taubman&nbsp;- Ben&#8209;Ari, Yoseph Azuri, and Eran Horowitz has recently been published in Stress and Health. The paper describes a study which aimed at examining the associations between the mental health of women entering fertility treatment and their internal resources, and indicating whether mental health is associated with age (above or below 35). The sample consisted of 137 women (76 aged 20-34, 61 aged 35-44) at the start of fertility treatment. Results indicated that younger women reported higher distress and rumination than older women. Higher hope was associated with greater well-being, while higher rumination was associated with greater distress. Furthermore, hope and rumination were found to mediate the association between age and mental health. These findings highlight the importance of developing age-based interventions for women entering fertility treatment, aimed at strengthening their resilience to effectively cope with the demanding process ahead.',

		content: "Noga Guggenheim came back from Kampala, Uganda, with some personal and professional impressions: In October 2016, I travelled to Uganda where my son and my daughter-in-law have been living and working in recent months. Uganda is an interesting country with wonderful nature experiences where I had the opportunity to witness many significant areas of interest, among them some professional ones. In this regard, for several years I have been involved in studying driving behavior and culture. Immediately after landing in Entebbe, the sights of transportation and driving habits during the ride from the airport to Kampala, put the visitor into a sudden shock. The eye finds it difficult and overwhelming to get used to the sight of the enormous crowding of cars and the fast-moving, overloaded motorcycles, huge masses of pedestrians crossing chaotically between vehicles, unmaintained roads, the conspicuous absence of sidewalks and countless vendors jumping on every car whenever it stops. In addition, although by law a driver's license is issued from the age of 18 - in practice it turns out that this is only a recommendation. Many drive without having a driving license. Traffic crashes are a great problem in the capital, and as a result, there are many casualties with loss of lives. Kampala itself has very limited public transportation, most trips are carried out in large taxis or using the Uber app. Another significant shuttle service are &ldquo;Boda Boda&rdquo;, motorcycles which are often extremely overloaded. It is common, for example, to see three or four people carrying baskets on a motorcycle. The sense of danger is lurking on the streets of Kampala in every turn, but it does not necessarily disturb the ones walking about the streets.",

		content: 'A new paper entitled &ldquo;The Multidimensional Driving Style Inventory a Decade Later: Review of the Literature and Re-evaluation of the Scale&rdquo; by Orit Taubman&nbsp;- Ben&#8209;Ari and Vera Skvirsky, has recently been published in Accident Analysis and Prevention. The paper employs two large data sets to summarize the accumulated knowledge, examining MDSI factors in samples of young drivers aged 17-21 (Study 1, n=1436) and older drivers aged 22-84 (Study 2, n=3409). Findings indicate that driving-related indicators are coherently and systematically related to the four driving styles in the expected directions, revalidating the structure of the MDSI. The results also help clarify the relationships between the driving styles and variables such as gender, ethnicity, car ownership, age, and experience, and suggest that driving styles are largely unaffected by sociodemographic characteristics, except for gender and ethnicity, and appear to represent a relatively stable and universal trait. The two studies highlight the validity and reliability of the MDSI, attesting to its practical value as a tool for purposes of research, evaluation, and intervention.',
