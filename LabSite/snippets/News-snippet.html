		<p id="news-p-content">We are very excited to announce that a new book: Pathways and barriers to parenthood – Existential concerns regarding fertility, pregnancy, and early parenthood, edited by Prof. Orit Taubman&nbsp;- Ben&#8209;Ari, has recently been published by Springer. The book explores the transition to parenthood from a holistic developmental approach, relating to barriers such as fertility problems and traumatic childbirth, as well as pathways such as positive experiences of pregnancy and childbirth. It presents an extended process, beginning with infertility issues, continuing with subjects pertaining to decisions regarding parenthood, pregnancy and birth, and ending with the early stages of parenthood from a positive psychology perspective. The volume draws on theories of resilience, meaning, terror management, and attachment, and considers psychological, sociological, legal, policy, medical, and therapy issues. It relates to the developmental needs of individuals and couples, as well as to the role played by family, society, and the media, offering a comprehensive in-depth evaluation of the latest topics.</p>
