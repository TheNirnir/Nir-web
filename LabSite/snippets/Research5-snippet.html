		<p id="research-explanation">This extensive series of studies examines a wide range of factors associated with reckless driving among young drivers, looking at personal, personality, motivational, familial, and social aspects. Among the most important achievements of this project is the formulation of the concept of Family Climate for Road Safety, along with an instrument for its assessment that can serve as a practical tool for families and practitioners.</p>
